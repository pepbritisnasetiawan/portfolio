The threat actor leveraged various tools, including Mimikatz, Metasploit, and AnyDesk. The threat actor leveraged RDP for lateral movement, deploying LockBit ransomware through multiple methods, including copying files over SMB shares for remote execution and automated distribution via PDQ Deploy. Sensitive data was exfiltrated using Rclone, transferring files to MEGA.io cloud storage. The intrusion had a rapid Time to Ransom (TTR) of around just two hours.",
